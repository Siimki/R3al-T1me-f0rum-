# R3al-T1me-F0rum

I changed the name of the repository so fellow 01edu platform users could not find and just copy it. 
This project was mostly made by me. The previous project was a forum which I did all solo. For this project, I implemented real-time messaging function. Roman joined me to fix some bugs and help to test all the features.

## With this project we learned about

- User sessions
- Crypting strings
- Archiecture of forum
- SQL, building up and using the database
- JS to display likes/dislikes in real-time
- SPA (Single Page Application)
- Chatbox and private messaging
- Go & JS websockets
